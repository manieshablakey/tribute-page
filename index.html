      <li>There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees.</li>
      <li>Bees are found on every continent except Antartica.</li>
			<li>Approximately one third of the food we eat is the result of honey bee pollination</li>
      <li>A colony of bees consists of 20,000-60,000 honey bees and one queen. Worker honey bees are female, live for about 6 weeks and do all the work.</li>
			<li>There are three types of bees in every hive: a queen, worker bees, and drones.</li>
			<li>The queen bee can live up to 5 years and is the only bee that lays eggs. A productive queen can lay up to 2,500 eggs per day.</li>
			<li>Only drones are male. They are larger than the worker bees, have no stinger and do no work. All they do is mate.</li>
			<li>The bees’ buzz is the sound made by their wings which beat 11,400 times per minute. </li>
			<li>One bee has to fly about 90,000 miles – three times around the globe – to make one pound of honey.</li>
			<li>The average bee will make only 1/12th of a teaspoon of honey in its lifetime</li>
			<li>Bees have 2 stomachs- one for eating and one for storing nectar.</li>
			<li>Honey lasts an incredibly long time. An explorer who found a 2000 year old jar of honey in an Egyptian tomb said it tasted delicious!</li>
			<li>Bees can be trained to locate buried landmines.</li>
			<li>Honey bees communicate with one another by dancing.</li>
			<li> If the queen bee dies, workers will create a new queen by selecting a young larva (the newly hatched baby insects) and feeding it a special food called “royal jelly“. This enables the larva to develop into a fertile queen.</li>
