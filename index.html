    <h4>Fifteen Fascinating Facts About Bees:</h4>
		<ol>
      		<li>There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees.</li>
     		<li>Bees are found on every continent <em>except Antartica</em>.</li>
      		<li>Approximately <em>one third of the food we eat</em> is the result of honey bee pollination</li>
      		<li>A colony of bees consists of 20,000-60,000 honey bees. There are three types of bees in every hive: a queen, worker bees and drones.</li>
			<li>The queen bee can live up to 5 years and is the only bee that lays eggs. A productive queen can lay up to 2,500 eggs per day.</li>
      		<li>Worker honey bees are female, live for about 6 weeks and do all the work.</le>
			<li>Only drones are male. They are larger than the worker bees, have no stinger and do no work. All they do is mate.</li>
			<li>The bees’ buzz is the sound made by their wings which beat 11,400 times per minute. </li>
     		<li>One bee has to fly about <em>90,000 miles</em> – three times around the globe – to make one pound of honey.</li>
			<li>The average bee will make only 1/12th of a teaspoon of honey in its lifetime</li>
      		<li>Bees have <em>2 stomachs</em>- one for eating and one for storing nectar.</li>
			<li>Honey lasts an incredibly long time. An explorer who found a 2000 year old jar of honey in an Egyptian tomb said it tasted delicious!</li>
			<li>Bees can be trained to locate buried landmines.</li>
      		<li>Honey bees communicate with one another by <em>dancing</em>.</li>
			<li> If the queen bee dies, workers will create a new queen by selecting a young larva (the newly hatched baby insects) and feeding it a special food called <em>royal jelly</em>. This enables the larva to develop into a fertile queen.</li>

		<blockquote>
 	 		<p>"The bee collects honey from flowers in such a way as to do the least damage or destruction to them, and he leaves them whole, undamaged and fresh, just as he found them."</p>
